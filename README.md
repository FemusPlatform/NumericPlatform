# NumericPlatform
Official repository of open-source code based Numerical Platform

The Numerical Platform has been developed as an environment where several numerical
codes can be run together, allowing to model complex physical phenomena on different
physical scales. 

The platform is organized into a hierarchical set of levels, namely
* Item 1: Level 0, main level of the Numerical Platform where the different components are gathered
* Item 2: Level 1, differentiation of Numerical Platform main components into
  ** Item 2a: PLAT_THIRD_PARTY
